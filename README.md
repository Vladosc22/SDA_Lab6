📌 Project Overview

This project is a Sales Data Analysis System implemented in C that processes a CSV file (sales.csv) containing product sales information and provides multiple analytical reports through a console-based menu.

The program demonstrates the use of:
	•	Linked Lists
	•	Hash Tables (with chaining)
	•	Dynamic Memory Allocation
	•	File Processing (CSV parsing)
	•	Sorting with qsort
	•	Data aggregation and statistical reporting

It is designed as a data structures and algorithms project focused on efficient data organization and analysis.
